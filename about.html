		<h3>Why?</h3>

		<p>During a global pandemic, some may seek safety and refuge in their homes. They seldom leave their house due to fear and hold off on essential things such as shopping or leisure activities, which can benefit mental health. As a result some local businesses are taking the hit and finding it harder and harder to stay afloat during these times. </p>

		<h3>Website Decription(When completed/will possibly be changed):</h3>

		<p>Our solution to the above problem is to create a website that allows users to filter through stores or other buisnesses to find one that suits their needs. Each store will be displayed with their COVID policies (e.g. Number of customers allowed in the store, mask policy, etc). The user can also filter by the type of stores such as restaurants or grocery stores, to make the process easier. This will allow users to feel like they are in control of their own health and safety while supporting local businesses.</p>
